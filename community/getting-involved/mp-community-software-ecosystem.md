# MP Community Software Ecosystem

### Overview

Many individuals both affiliated and unaffiliated with MP have published software that directly builds upon core MP resources. This page seeks to highlight such efforts so their hard work can be recognized and so you can learn about new tools that might benefit your own research.

{% hint style="info" %}
Refer to the [Materials Project-hosted codes](contributor-guide.md#official-materials-project-codes) section in the Contributor Guide for the main packages that are directly supported by the Materials Project. A full list can be found on the [`materialsproject`](https://github.com/materialsproject) GitHub organization page.

### The MP Community Software Ecosystem

{% hint style="info" %}
This list is not exhaustive. If you would like to make a suggestion to add here, please contact **TODO**. \
\
All listed programs must use one of the primary [Materials Project-hosted codes](contributor-guide.md#official-materials-project-codes) as a core dependency in a non-artificial way and be actively maintained (defined here as a commit within the last year).

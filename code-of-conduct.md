# Code of Conduct

The Materials Project does not have a unified code of conduct at present since it is a joint, collaborative effort, and different aspects of the Materials Project, such as its different open-source codes, are led and maintained by different individuals at different institutions.

However, as guidance, we refer all contributors to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code\_of\_conduct/) for setting expectations for each other. Text from the Contributor Covenant is copied below.

We have set up the [conduct@materialsproject.org](mailto:conduct@materialsproject.org) email address for any issues involving inappropriate conduct.&#x20;

### Our Pledge <a href="#our-pledge" id="our-pledge"></a>

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards <a href="#our-standards" id="our-standards"></a>

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment

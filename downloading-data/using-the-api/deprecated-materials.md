# Deprecated Materials

The Materials Project is constantly updating its data with more accurate calculations and improved standards. As a result, some materials are "deprecated" to facilitate access to the highest quality data available, which is where older calculations are hidden from default search results but are still searchable using our API and website. A list of deprecated entries and their reasons for deprecation is maintained in the [Materials Project Github user guide](https://github.com/materialsproject/docs/blob/master/docs/user-guide/deprecations.md).

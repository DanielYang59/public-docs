# Phase Diagrams (PDs)

## Introduction

A **phase diagram** is a calculation of the _thermodynamic phase equilibria_ of multicomponent systems. It is an important tool in materials science for revealing 1) thermodynamic stability of compounds, 2) predicted equilibrium chemical reactions, and 3) processing conditions for synthesizing materials. However, the experimental determination of a phase diagram is an extremely time-consuming process, requiring careful synthesis and characterization of all phases in a chemical system.

Computational modeling tools, such as the density functional theory (DFT) methods used by the Materials Project, can accelerate compositional phase diagram construction significantly. By calculating the energies of all known compounds in a given chemical system (e.g. the lithium/iron/oxygen chemical system, Li-Fe-O), we can determine the phase diagram for that system at a temperature of $$T=0$$ K and pressure of $$P=0$$ **** atm. Furthermore, for systems comprised of predominantly solid phases open with respect to a gaseous element, approximations can be made as to the finite temperature and pressure phase diagrams.

In this section, we will describe the theory/methodology behind the calculation of compositional phase diagrams.

## Methodology

This section will discuss how to construct phase diagrams from DFT-calculated energies. This is exact process done by the Materials Project (MP) for computing formation energies, thermodynamic stability, and phase diagrams. This methodology has been implemented in Python within the **pymatgen** package. Please see [#code-pymatgen](phase-diagrams-pds.md#code-pymatgen "mention")for brief examples of how to build phase diagrams on your own.

### Acquiring thermodynamic data

### Calculating formation energy

The formation energy, $$\Delta E_f$$, is the energy change upon reacting to form a phase of interest from its constituent components. The components typically used are the constituent elements. For a phase composed of $$N$$ components indexed by $$i$$, the formation energy can be calculated as follows:

$$\Delta E_f  = E - \sum_i^N{n_i\mu_i}$$

where $$E$$ is the total energy of the phase of interest, $$n_i$$is the total number of moles of component $$i$$, and $$\mu_i$$ is the total energy of component $$i$$. **Note** that $$\mu_i$$is often referred to as the chemical potential of the component, however, this is only rigorously true when working with Gibbs free energies, $$G$$.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example:**

For barium titanate, BaTiO$$_3$$, the formation energy would be calculated as:

$$\Delta E_f (BaTiO_3) = E(BaTiO_3) - 1*\mu_{Ba} - 1*\mu_{Ti} - 3*\mu_{O}$$&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Typically, formation energies are **normalized** on a per-atom basis by dividing by the number of atoms in 1 mole of formula. For example, for BaTiO$$_3$$, the normalized per-atom formation energy would be calculated by dividing the $$E_f$$ above by _5 atoms._

#### Visualizing the phase diagram

### Grand potential phase diagram

TODO

In many scientific applications, the phase equilibria of interest is not that of a closed system, but rather one which is open to a particular element. For instance, synthesis might be carried out in flowing Argon gas at a particular temperature, which would mean the system is open to gaseous elements such as oxygen. Other experiments may be carried out in air, which essentially serves as an infinite reservoir of atmospheric elements such as oxygen, nitrogen and others.

In environments that are open to a particular element (say oxygen), the relevant control variable is the chemical potential of that element, $\mu\_{O}$. The relevant thermodynamic potential to study phase equilibria in an open system is the grand potential, which is defined as the following for an $\ce{Li-Fe-O}$ system that is open with respect to oxygen.



## **Accuracy of Calculated Phase Diagrams**

**TODO**

In general, we can expect that compositional phase diagrams comprising of predominantly solid phases to be reproduced fairly well by our calculations. However, it should be noted that there are inherent limitations in accuracy in the DFT calculated energies. Furthermore, our calculated phase diagrams are at 0 K and 0 atm, and differences with non-zero temperature phase diagrams are to be expected.

For grand potential phase diagrams, further approximations are made as to the entropic contributions.[^2](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.elecom.2010.01.010) They are therefore expected to be less accurate, but nonetheless provide useful insights on general trends.

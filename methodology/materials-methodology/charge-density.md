# Charge Density

Charge density data is obtained directly from the CHGCAR files that are output by our static DFT calculations. For more detailed information about this data [see the VASP wiki](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/CHGCAR).

An isosurface visualization of the charge density can be found on the material details pages. To obtain the full set of volumetric data for a given material [the API should be used.](../../downloading-data/using-the-api/examples.md#charge-density-for-silicon-mp-149)&#x20;

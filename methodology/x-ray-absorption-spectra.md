# X-ray Absorption Spectra (XAS)

X-ray Absorption Spectra (XAS) is calculated using the code FEFF$$^{1,2,3}$$.Feff is an ab initio multiple-scattering code for calculating excitation spectra and electronic structure. It is based on a real space Greenâ€™s function approach including a screened core-hole, inelastic losses and self-energy shifts, and Debye-Waller factors. The spectra include extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and then both are stiched together to give a total XAS spectra. In addition the code can treat relativistic electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).&#x20;

Multiple parameters are checked for convergence, including:

* _Self-consistent field (SCF)_
* _Full multiple scattering (FMS)_
* _EXCHANGE_: The EXCHANGE card specifies the exchange correlation potential model used for XANES calculation.&#x20;
* _COREHOLE_: The COREHOLE card is used for specifying how the core is treated during XANES calculation.&#x20;

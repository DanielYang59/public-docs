# Calculation Details

We use DFT as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) software [\[1\]](./#references) to evaluate the total energy of compounds. For the exchange-correlational functional, we employ a mix of Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) and GGA+_U_, or a mix of GGA, GGA+U, and r2SCAN. Both mixing schemes are [described here](../materials-methodology/thermodynamic-stability/thermodynamic-stability/).  All calculations are performed at 0 K and 0 atm. All computations are performed with spin polarization on and with magnetic ions in a high-spin ferromagnetic initialization (the system can of course relax to a low spin state during the DFT relaxation). For a select number of materials, alternate spin states are searched for. Details on this can be found in the [Magnetic Properties section](../magnetic-properties.md).

Input structures are sourced from many different places, including the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). [\[2\]](./#references) We relax all cell and atomic positions in our calculation two times in consecutive runs. When multiple crystal structures are present for a single chemical composition, we attempt to evaluate all unique structures as determined by an affine mapping technique. [\[3\]](./#references)

# Atomic Partial Spins

Atomic partial spins can be defined similarly to atomic partial charges for molecules with unpaired electrons ("open-shell" molecules; "closed-shell" molecules with no upaired electrons have 0 net spin and therefore 0 partial spin on each atom, by definition). We currently calculate atomic partial spins using two methods: Mulliken population analysis \[1] and natural atomic populations from NBO \[2, 3]. While Mulliken partial charges can be unreliable, we have generally found that Mulliken partial spins are qualitatively similar to those obtained from NBO and can therefore be treated without prejudice.

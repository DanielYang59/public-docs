# Suggested Substrates

## Introduction

Synthesizing 2D materials and thin films comes comes with a challenge: how does one determine which subtrate to use? Common substrate materials include Al, SiO \$$\_2\$$ , Sapphire



Heterogeneous interfaces has a lot of different properties: substrate material, film material, cleavage planes, lattice mismatches, and resultant stresses and strains.&#x20;

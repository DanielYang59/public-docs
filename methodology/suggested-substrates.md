# Suggested Substrates

## Introduction

Materials synthesis techniques such as Chemical Vapor Deposition, Molecular Beam Eptixay, Sputtering, etc. are prevalent in materials research. Synthesizing materials with these techniques comes with a challenge: how does one determine which subtrate to use?

Epitaxial growth of heterogeneous interfaces requires a fundamental understanding of the substrate material, film material, cleavage planes, lattice mismatches, and resultant stresses and strains. The Materials Project (MP) stores crystallographic information for each material in its database, calculated via First Principles Density Functional Theory. Each material's crystallographic information, in particular the surface termination lattice parameters, is especially useful to find the epitaxial matches between a desired material (film) and a corresponding substrate. The Suggested Substrates tool outputs the Miller Indices of the substrate and the film (target material) termination plane, the minimal co-incident area (MCIA), and Elastic Energy.

## Calculation Details

The methodology for the Suggested Substrates tool is based off of Zurr and McGill \[1]

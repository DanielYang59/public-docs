# Introduction

This is public documentation for the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org) (MP). The Materials Project is a decade-long effort from the Department of Energy to pre-compute properties of "materials" and make this data publicly available, with the intent of accelerating the process of materials discovery. In this context, a material can mean either an inorganic crystal (like silicon), or a molecule (like ethylene). Possible applications are vast, but might include better batteries, solar energy, water splitting, optoelectronics, catalysts and more (see [here](https://materialsproject.org/about/publications) for a list of publications).

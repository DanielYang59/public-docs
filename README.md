# Introduction

This is public documentation for the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org) (MP). The Materials Project is a decade-long effort from the Department of Energy to pre-compute properties of "materials" and make this data publicly available, with the intent of accelerating the process of materials discovery. In this context, a material can mean either an inorganic crystal (like silicon), or a molecule (like ethylene carbonate). Possible applications are vast, but might include better batteries, solar energy, water splitting, optoelectronics, catalysts and more (see [here](https://materialsproject.org/about/publications) for a list of publications).

### Apps

This section talks about how we present information on the Materials Project website as "apps", and what these apps contain.

### Getting Involved

The Materials Project is a public, collaborative project, offered free of charge. It only succeeds thanks to the efforts of everyone who participates! Visit this section to learn how to get involved.

### Errors

If you notice an error or omission, please let us know at [our user forum located at matsci.org/materials-project](https://matsci.org/materials-project) or directly via [feedback@materialsproject.org](mailto:feedback@materialsproject.org)

The Materials Project documentation is a living document and always a work-in-progress.

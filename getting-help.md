# Getting Help

## Materials Science Community Forum at matsci.org

The Materials Project runs a forum at [matsci.org](https://matsci.org) intended as a shared space for several computational materials science projects, as well as general discussion about materials science. For the past several years, this effort has been co-run by the OpenKIM project. See [About matsci.org](https://matsci.org/faq) for more information about the forum and its governance.

All questions are welcome here! See our category at [https://matsci.org/materials-project](https://matsci.org/materials-project).

### Contact

Please reach out to us on the [forum](https://matsci.org/materials-project): if questions or feedback are asked in a public setting, it allows others to benefit from seeing the answer too, and allows more people to participate in the conversation.

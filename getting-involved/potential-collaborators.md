# Potential Collaborators

The Materials Project welcomes collaborations and strives to maintain an environment where people are encouraged to share their findings as well as their analysis methods. If you are interested in collaborating with others or are seeking ways to actively contribute:

* Join the weekly infrastructure update Zoom call and listen to decisions being made to improve the Materials Project or bring up a specific item to discuss. To get added to the calendar invite, please send an email to <mark style="color:blue;">feedback@materialsproject.org</mark> with the subject line "Request to Join MP Update Call" and a brief introduction about you as well as your interest.
* Attend the Annual PI meeting or Triennial Review meetings. They happen a few times a year, and you can learn more about the direction of the Materials Project as well as future plans. Please send an email to <mark style="color:blue;">feedback@materialsproject.org</mark> for more information.
* Reach out to [people who are heavily involved](https://materialsproject.org/about/people) in the Materials Project, especially if you are already contributing to code on Github (ie: pymatgen) and would like to get in contact or work with people who maintain/review these repositories. You can read more about their involvement, field of expertise, current projects and see if their goals align with yours.

# Crystal Toolkit

"Crystal Toolkit" refers to two things:

* An app on the Materials Project that allows manipulation and transformation of crystal structures, both from the Materials Project database or uploaded by the user.
* It refers to the [underlying Crystal Toolkit code](https://docs.crystaltoolkit.org), which was developed to write this app and which now powers the entire Materials Project website!

This documentation page shows how to use the app specifically.

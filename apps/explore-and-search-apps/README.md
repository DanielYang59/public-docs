# Explore and Search Apps

These apps are for exploring and searching the datasets available in Materials Project. This section provides an overview, tutorials, and FAQ for each of the [**Explore and Search apps**](https://materialsproject.org/apps) **** on the Materials Project (MP) website.

Most data in "Explorer" apps are generated directly by Materials Project, but some are contributed by third parties, such as the Catalysis Explorer by the Open Catalyst Project, and the MOF Explorer, by Andrew Rosen et al.

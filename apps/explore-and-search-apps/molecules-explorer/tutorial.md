Visit [Molecules Explorer](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/molecules);

1. Search for molecules, either by entering search criteria in the search box:

or else apply filters using the box on the left:

4\. Clicking on a molecule ID will take you to the detail page. At the top of the page, a 3D molecular structure is shown, as well as basic properties like the point group, charge, and spin multiplicity:

5\. In MPcules, properties may be calculated in different solvent environments. You can select which properties you want to see by selecting from the drop-down menu on the right:

### Background

MOFs are highly tunable materials composed of inorganic ions or clusters ("nodes") connected by organic ligands ("linkers") that yield a crystalline structure. To date, tens of thousands of MOFs have been experimentally synthesized, and virtually unlimited more can be hypothesized based on plausible node and linker building blocks.

The MOF Explorer ([https://materialsproject.org/mofs](https://materialsproject.org/mofs)) provides an interactive interface to the Quantum MOF (MOF) Database, which contains DFT-computed properties for \~20,000 MOFs and related MOF-like materials.

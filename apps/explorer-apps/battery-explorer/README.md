# Battery Explorer

In this section, we present several ways to navigate through the Battery Explorer.&#x20;

The Battery Explorer app allows users to filter candidate battery materials using chemical formula/composition, as well as properties such as maximum volume change, average voltage, capacity, stability etc.

In each individual page for a battery material, the user can find information regarding the material such as calculated properties, voltage curve, oxygen evolution graph and a visulization of the host material.

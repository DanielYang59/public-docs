# Pourbaix Diagram

{% hint style="danger" %}
Known issue: there is a problem generating Pourbaix diagrams for Zn-S [(kindly reported by lshiau on the forum)](https://matsci.org/t/unable-to-generate-pourbaix-diagram-zns/43329). This is under investigation.
{% endhint %}

In this section, we review how to use the Pourbaix Diagram app to generate Pourbaix diagrams for different elements. The app can generate diagrams for up to 4 elements at a time. We show generating the Fe and Fe-Cr Pourbaix diagram and illustrate some of the Advanced Options available in the app.

# Topology

The MOF topology describes the number of vertices, edges, and connectivity of the MOF building blocks. Several thousand topologies can be explored on the [Reticular Chemistry Structure Resource](http://rcsr.anu.edu.au/nets). In the QMOF Database, the topology is detected using [MOFid](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.cgd.9b01050) based on the [available topologies](http://rcsr.anu.edu.au/systre) in the RCSR as of June 1st, 2019.
